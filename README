To run the file with mininet, simply type:

sudo python -tt run.py

Then follow the on screen instructions to create the approriate topologies and run the appropriate tests.

Current topologies:

Fattree --> Creates a standard Fattree topology with desired fannout. (Works best with fannout 8 or less)
Jellyfish --> Creates a random Jellfish topology with desired number of ports per switch.

Note: A Fattree with the same fan-out as a Jelly will contain the same number of switches and hosts
meaning that both graphs are resource equivalent.
     
The following tests are available:

 Iperf Test --> Measures average throughput of the network with half of the nodes performing iperf tests
 Ping Test --> Gives ping information from one host to another
 Print All Paths --> Prints all of the switches that a packet hits from one host to another from a pingall
