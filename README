To run the file with mininet, simply type:

sudo python -tt run.py

Then follow the on screen instructions to create the approriate topologies and run the appropriate tests.

Current topologies:

Fattree --> Creates a standard Fattree topology with desired fanout. (Works best with fanout 8 or less)
Jellyfish --> Creates a random Jellfish topology with desired number of ports per switch.

Note: A Fattree with the same fan-out as a Jelly will contain the same number of switches and hosts
meaning that both graphs are resource equivalent.

Our code for the fattree topology was based off the following: https://github.com/dcarou/MininetSimpleAndFatTreeTopology/blob/master/mininet.py

The following tests are available:

 Iperf Test --> Measures average throughput of the network with half of the nodes performing iperf tests
 Ping Test --> Gives ping information from one host to another
 Print All Paths --> Prints all of the switches that a packet hits from one host to another from a pingall

To run Jupyter notebook:
  Access the virtual environment by typing:
      source ./env/bin/activate
  
  Then run the jupyter server by typing:
      jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser &
 
 When the jupyter server is running, locate your external ip on GCP and append port 8888"
      Example--> http://0.0.0.0:8888
  
  Locate the jupyter folder (labeled) with file:
      data-analysis.ipynb
      
  Run the scripts after performing iPerf Tests to see changes 
  
  password/access token is "cloud"

If there are any issues, email anyone on the team!

If all else fails, please try running run.py again!
