To run the file with mininet, simply type:

sudo python -tt topo.py

Then follow the on screen instructions to create the approriate topologies and run the appropriate tests.


To test the pathTracker do the following:

Open two ssh instances and do the following commands in order on the appopriate instances.

     On instance 1:

     	sudo python startFatTree.py
     	mininet> pingall


     On instance 2:

     	python tracePacket.py


If you wanna see all paths for all combinations of hosts, replace tracePacket.py
with traceAllPackets.py


I will attempt to make this doable on one instance but this should do for now.
